# Embedded Operating Systems
> I want to express my gratitude to Dawson Engler, the instructor of the CS140e course. Although I'm not a Stanford student, I came across his materials one day, which inspired me to dive into the world of embedded operating systems.

> This repository is dedicated to guiding you through the process of writing your own operating system for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.

## What You Need for This Course
1. An ARM-based Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
2. Two LED lights
3. Two jumper wires for connections

## About This Course
1. Unlike traditional operating system courses that often rely on virtual machines for emulation, this course takes a different approach.
2. Here, you will write an operating system entirely from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with hardware-level programming on the Raspberry Pi.
